            You say I’ll never be nothing, cause us suffering, something to ignore <br>
             <br>
            These things you say <br>
            You make me weak but I have changed <br>
            No way, I am stronger than before <br>
             <br>
            I will break, (break) breaking free, coming alive <br>
            I broke these chains, never be afraid to live my life (never be afraid to live my life) <br>
            Break, (break) breaking free, one last time <br>
            No matter what they say, I will never change <br>
            And I know I can break (break) break (break) <br>
            Look out, I’m breaking free <br>

             <br>
            These things (these things) you say (you say) <br>
            They don’t hold me, I’m not your slave <br>
            No way, I’m stronger than before <br>

            Look out, I’m breaking free <br>
             <br>
            Overcome, (oh oh oh) chains undone (oh oh oh) <br>
