    <h3>Cynical</h3>

    <div class="dropdown-content" id="dropdown1">
        <p>There's a cynical feeling saying I should give up <br>
            You said everything you'll ever say <br>
            There's a moment of panic when I hear the phone ring <br>
            Anxiety's calling in my head <br>
            Is it back again? <br>
            Are you back again? <br>
            <br>
            ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ <br>
            <br>
            Ah!<br>
            <br>
            ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ <br>
            <br>
            Don't wake me up before you leave <br>
            Is there the slightest trace of what you once believed?  <br>Woahh <br>
            I feel your hand unlock the door <br>
            Leaving fingerprints of water in the oil, woahh <br>
            <br>
            What's the point of saying sorry now? <br>
            Lost my voice while fighting my way out <br>
            While fighting my way out <br>
            What's the point of saying sorry now? <br>
            Not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry <br>
            Lost my voice while fighting my way out <br>
            Not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry now... <br></p>

    <h3>Rabbit Hole</h3>

    <div class="dropdown-content" id="dropdown2">
        <p>Dear head, shut up <br>
            I can't listen no more <br>
            It's late, so shut up <br>
            Is one night too much to ask for? <br>
             <br>
            You are a haunted house <br>
            You're superstitious <br>
            You are the coldest stone carved marble faces <br>
             <br>
            I won't fall down that --- rabbit hole <br>
            I'm barely standing on the ground <br>
            All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all <br>
            I won't fall down that --- rabbit hole <br>
             <br>
            With you with you with you with you again <br>
            With you with you with you with you again <br>
             <br>
            This bed, on fire <br>
            I can't sleep here no more <br>
            Too late, and tired <br>
            Dreaming down on the floor <br>
             <br>
            I am a haunted house <br>
            I'm superstitious <br>
            I am a cardboard cutout, old and faded <br>
             <br>
            I won't fall down that --- rabbit hole <br>
            I'm barely standing on the ground <br>
            All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all <br>
            I won't fall down that --- rabbit hole <br>
             <br>
            With you with you with you with you again <br>
            With you with you with you with you again <br>
            With you with you with you with you again <br>
            With you with you with you with you again <br>
             <br>
            I won't fall down that --- rabbit hole <br>
            (I won't fall down, I won't fall down) <br>
            I'm barely standing on the ground <br>
            (Barely standing on the ground) <br>
            All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all <br>
            I won't fall down that --- rabbit hole <br>
            (I won't fall down that --- rabbit hole) <br>
            Oh-o oh-o oh-o <br>
            Oh-o oh-o oh-o oh-oo <br>

        <p>Remember the days <br>
            We would drink on the train <br>
            On our way to the show, Chicago <br>
            Naked Raygun live at the Cabaret Metro <br>
            Ten bucks to get into a fight you can't win <br>
            Boots and braces, yellow laces <br>
            Oxblood traces of the night before <br>
             <br>
            We are forgotten young suburbia <br>
            Loose on the streets of California <br>
            Underneath fluorescent lights <br>
            We'll waste the best nights of our life <br>
            --- This place, let's put up a parking lot <br>
            (Na, na na, na na, na na <br>
            Na, na na, na na, na na) <br>
            --- This place, let's put up a parking lot <br>
             <br>
            I can't wait 'til I'm off of work <br>
            I'll meet my friends at the Target curb <br>
            I rolled my ankle, Matt just broke his wrist <br>
            I climbed through your window at 3am <br>
            We listened to The Smiths and The Violent Femmes <br>
            Yeah, we both sang, "Why can't I get one kiss?" <br>
             <br>
            We are forgotten young suburbia <br>
            Loose on the streets of California <br>
            Underneath fluorescent lights <br>
            We'll waste the best nights of our life <br>
            --- This place, let's put up a parking lot <br>
             <br>
            We are the broken <br>
            No end in sight <br>
            We're the forgotten soldiers you left behind <br>
            There's no use trying <br>
            We lost the war <br>
            Now the dead and dying <br>
            Are back to even the score <br>
             <br>
            We are forgotten young suburbia <br>
            Loose on the streets of California <br>
            Underneath fluorescent lights <br>
            We'll waste the best nights of our life <br>

            All we needed was your lifeline (Is it better? Is it better now?) <br>
            We swore we'd be better than the last time (Are we better? Are we better now?) <br>
            Don't leave, tell me that you're all right (Is it better? Is it better now?) <br>
            I'm not the generational divide (Are we better? Are we better now?) <br></p>
