        <p>(Make no mistakes) <br>
            Time is just a fuse <br>
            It's burning fast, nothing lasts <br>
            Every which way you lose <br>
            (What's to explain?) <br>
            There's nothing left to say <br>
            You're living fast, --- the past <br>
            Looking like a heart attack <br>
             <br>
            In life it seems we fade away <br>
            I'm fully empty, fueled with apathy <br>
             <br>
            And now I'm done with lies <br>
            And everything that you've gotta say <br>
            I've opened my mind <br>
            But it's more than I could ever take <br>
            And if I had more time <br>
            Well, maybe I could find some faith <br>
            I can't spend my life <br>
            Just waiting on a twist of fate <br>
             <br>
            In time, why don't you look at what you've done? <br>
            Lies 'cause I bet you think you've won <br>
             <br>
            We live and die with no explanations <br>
            What might have been's got you against the wall <br>
             <br>
            And now I'm done with lies <br>
            And everything that you've gotta say <br>
            I've opened my mind <br>
            But it's more than I could ever take <br>
            And if I had more time <br>
            Well, maybe I could find some faith <br>
            I can't spend my life <br>
            Just waiting on a twist of fate <br>

            üé∂üé∂üé∂ <br>
             <br>
            Done with lies and all that you gotta say <br>
            'Cause in my mind, it's more than I could take <br>
             <br>
            And now I'm done with lies <br>
            And everything that you've gotta say <br>
            I've opened my mind <br>

            Well, maybe I could find some faith <br>
            I can't spend my life <br>
            Just waiting on a twist of fate, sing <br>
             <br>
            In life it seems we fade away <br>
            I'm fully empty, fueled with apathy <br>
            In life it seems we fade away <br>

        <p>And I don't wanna believe <br>
            That maybe this is the end <br>
            I know you're kind of a tease <br>
            But is this really pretend? <br>
            Something tells me I'm wrong <br>
            With you, I never can tell <br>
            The way you drag‚Åüme‚Åüalong <br>
            The way I‚Åüput you through‚ÅüHell <br>
             <br>
            Tell me, am I insane? <br>
            Is this where we belong? <br>
            Is it pleasure or pain? <br>
            How we're still hanging on? <br>
            Going out of my head <br>
            You know true love is dead <br>
            But what you said has got me hanging on <br>
             <br>
            I can't help but walk through your landmines <br>
            Ten feet and I'm going out of my mind <br>
            I'm not right without you, is that so wrong? <br>
            I can't help but walk through your landmin–µs <br>
            I'm bleeding and all I need is a sign <br>
            I'm out here and I've been waiting so long <br>
             <br>
            Oh-oh-woah <br>

            You've got me hanging <br>
             <br>
            And maybe I'm outta luck <br>
            Or maybe all of it's bad <br>
            I'm not sure why we broke up <br>
            It was the best that I had <br>
            They say, "It's all for the best" <br>
            I think that fate is a lie <br>
            And now my hair is a mess <br>
            And you're a little bit high <br>
             <br>
            Should I give it a chance? <br>
            Is it ever enough? <br>
            No more blood on our hands <br>
            No more --- it up <br>
            Going out of my head <br>
            All the tears that I bled <br>
            And what you said has got me hanging on <br>

            Or is it time for me to go? <br>
            I don't wanna waste another minute <br>
            No, the story's getting old <br>
            All I wanna know is whether I should stay <br>

        <p>You said you did it for the dopamine <br>
            You didn't mean to leave me so --- up <br>
            You did it for the dopamine <br>
            And could it be that I'm just not enough? <br>
            It's so hard to accept that you're gone and that's it <br>
            You did it for the dopamine, and it didn't mean anything at all <br>
             <br>
            God, I've been up for days <br>
            I've been losing my mind <br>
            Caught up thinking of ways I could turn back the time <br>
            Time is not on my side <br>
            I don't know what to say <br>
            Feeling empty inside now that she's gone away <br>
            I can picture you in someone else's place <br>
            And he's got his hands running down your face <br>
            Is it in my head cause I just can't let my demons go <br>

            You did it for the dopamine, and it didn't mean anything at all <br>
             <br>
            I guess you threw it away <br>
            I don't know who to blame <br>
            Leave it all at a day and just put out the flame <br>
            Told me time and again you don't believe in the past <br>
            It was us against them but nothing good could last <br>
            I can feel it now, and it hurts like hell <br>
            Can you live without me? Only time will tell <br>
            Is it in my head cause I just can't let my demons go <br>

            And cheers to the memories <br>
            Burn, there's no shadow of a doubt <br>
            I blame you all for every --- thing <br>
            God help us, it's all --- up and now <br>
            The further we go, we wind up in hell <br>
             <br>

             <br>
            Burn down this house of liars now I say <br>
            You're guilty as sin can be <br>
            Wanna watch it all go down in flames <br>
            And cheers to the memories <br>
            Burn, there's no shadow of a doubt <br>
            I blame you all for every --- thing <br>
            God help us, it's all --- up and now <br>
            The further we go, we wind up in hell <br>
