        <p>(Make no mistakes) <br>
            Time is just a fuse <br>
            It's burning fast, nothing lasts <br>
            Every which way you lose <br>
            (What's to explain?) <br>
            There's nothing left to say <br>
            You're living fast, --- the past <br>
            Looking like a heart attack <br>
             <br>
            In life it seems we fade away <br>
            I'm fully empty, fueled with apathy <br>
             <br>
            And now I'm done with lies <br>
            And everything that you've gotta say <br>
            I've opened my mind <br>
            But it's more than I could ever take <br>
            And if I had more time <br>
            Well, maybe I could find some faith <br>
            I can't spend my life <br>
            Just waiting on a twist of fate <br>
             <br>
            In time, why don't you look at what you've done? <br>
            Lies 'cause I bet you think you've won <br>
             <br>
            We live and die with no explanations <br>
            What might have been's got you against the wall <br>
             <br>
            And now I'm done with lies <br>
            And everything that you've gotta say <br>
            I've opened my mind <br>
            But it's more than I could ever take <br>
            And if I had more time <br>
            Well, maybe I could find some faith <br>
            I can't spend my life <br>
            Just waiting on a twist of fate <br>
             <br>
            üé∂üé∂üé∂ <br>
             <br>
            Done with lies and all that you gotta say <br>
            'Cause in my mind, it's more than I could take <br>
             <br>
            And now I'm done with lies <br>
            And everything that you've gotta say <br>
            I've opened my mind <br>
            But it's more than I could ever take <br>
            And if I had more time <br>
            Well, maybe I could find some faith <br>
            I can't spend my life <br>
            Just waiting on a twist of fate, sing <br>
             <br>
            In life it seems we fade away <br>
            I'm fully empty, fueled with apathy <br>

    <h3>Landmines</h3>

    <div class="dropdown-content" id="dropdown2">
        <p>And I don't wanna believe <br>
            That maybe this is the end <br>
            I know you're kind of a tease <br>
            But is this really pretend? <br>
            Something tells me I'm wrong <br>
            With you, I never can tell <br>
            The way you drag‚Åüme‚Åüalong <br>
            The way I‚Åüput you through‚ÅüHell <br>
             <br>
            Tell me, am I insane? <br>
            Is this where we belong? <br>
            Is it pleasure or pain? <br>
            How we're still hanging on? <br>
            Going out of my head <br>
            You know true love is dead <br>
            But what you said has got me hanging on <br>
             <br>
            I can't help but walk through your landmines <br>
            Ten feet and I'm going out of my mind <br>
            I'm not right without you, is that so wrong? <br>
            I can't help but walk through your landmin–µs <br>
            I'm bleeding and all I need is a sign <br>
            I'm out here and I've been waiting so long <br>
             <br>
            Oh-oh-woah <br>
            Oh-ooh-woah-oh <br>
            You'v–µ got me hanging on <br>
            Oh-oh-woah <br>
            Oh-ooh-woah-oh <br>
            You've got me hanging <br>
             <br>
            And maybe I'm outta luck <br>
            Or maybe all of it's bad <br>
            I'm not sure why we broke up <br>
            It was the best that I had <br>
            They say, "It's all for the best" <br>
            I think that fate is a lie <br>
            And now my hair is a mess <br>
            And you're a little bit high <br>
             <br>
            Should I give it a chance? <br>
            Is it ever enough? <br>
            No more blood on our hands <br>
            No more --- it up <br>
            Going out of my head <br>
            All the tears that I bled <br>
            And what you said has got me hanging on <br>
            
            I can't help but walk through your landmines <br>
            Ten feet and I'm going out of my mind <br>

            Oh-oh-woah <br>
            Oh-ooh-woah-oh <br>
            You've got me hanging on <br>
             <br>
            All I need to know is should I stay <br>
            Or is it time for me to go? <br>
            I don't wanna waste another minute <br>
            No, the story's getting old <br>
            All I wanna know is whether I should stay <br>
            Or is it time for me to go? <br>
             <br>
            I can't help but walk through your landmines <br>
