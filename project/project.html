    <h2>Site Name</h2> 
    <p>cashlyrics.com</p>
    <p>This name represents that there lyrics here. My lyrics that I'm putting on here, that's where the "cash" part of the url comes into. Some might think cash like money, which is fine to me. It can work both ways.</p>

    <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
    <p>This site provides lyrics to songs from many different artists. These will be clean lyrics on my website. So any songs with noddy words will be dahsed out. This will be the best place to hold all the lyrics I've made from songs that I listen to.</p>

    <h2>Scenarios</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Are you going to have all songs from every artist?</li>
        <li>Can I request a song to be added if I don't see it on your website?</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2>Color Schema</h2>
    <p>I will use the main colors of dark green and light gray. I will also use some black for maybe some certain headers with white text. I will use green for the main header and footer content to represent the website color, and use light gray for the background in the body since there's going to be lots of text on my website.</p>

    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p>For my website font, I will use the Roboto Condensed font for everything. Headers, body, main, and footer.</p>

    <h2>Wireframe</h2>
    <p>My wireframe will just be basic and become smaller when it's in the mobile view. In the desktop version, I will have some whitespace on the sides so everything is more centered. On the mobile page it will be streched out to the devices width.</p>
